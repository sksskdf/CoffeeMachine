<p>Now, let's consider a case when you need a lot of coffee. You're hosting a party with a lot of guests! In these circumstances, it's better to make preparations in advance.</p>

<p>We will ask users to enter the desired amount of coffee in cups. After this, the program should calculate how much water, coffee, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffee.</p>

<p>Of course, this much coffee is not required right now, so at this stage, the coffee machine doesn't actually make coffee.</p>

<h5 id="objectives" style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h5>

<p>Let's break the task into several steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read how much coffee the machine needs to make (in cups);</li>
	<li>Figure out how much of each ingredient is required. Note that one cup of coffee contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans;</li>
	<li>Output the required ingredients.</li>
</ol>
