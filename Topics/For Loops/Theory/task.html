<h2>For Loops</h2>

  <p>Sometimes programmers need to repeat the same part of code several times over. Assume that you go to work every day, Monday to Friday, and greet your colleague Nessie as you get to your office: “Hi Nessie!” Let's simulate this situation using the tools we already have:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("1, Hi Nessie!"); // Monday
console.log("2, Hi Nessie!"); // Tuesday
console.log("3, Hi Nessie!"); // Wednesday
console.log("4, Hi Nessie!"); // Thursday
console.log("5, Hi Nessie!"); // Friday</code></pre> 
  <p>We can create a loop instead of all that repetition:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">let i;
for (i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i + ", Hi Nessie!");
}</code></pre> 
  <p>This is way faster and more convenient, especially if we have to repeat the same stuff 10 times, 100 times or even more.</p> 
  <p>Let's zoom in on the syntax of the <code class="language-javascript">for</code> loop. We set a variable before the loop: the <code class="language-javascript">i</code> counter. Next, the condition inside the brackets has three parts: <code class="language-javascript">(...;...;...)</code>. The initial value of the counter variable comes first; in our case, it equals <code class="language-javascript">1</code>. The second part is the condition in which the loop keeps working, which in our case is <code class="language-javascript">i &lt;= 5</code>. Finally, in the third part, we indicate how exactly the counter should change from one iteration to another. The <code class="language-javascript">i++</code> recording is the same as <code class="language-javascript">i = i + 1</code>, that is, the counter ranges from <code class="language-javascript">1</code> to <code class="language-javascript">5</code> with the step of <code class="language-javascript">1</code> at each iteration. Any part of the condition inside the brackets is optional and can be omitted.</p> 
  <h5 id="infinite-loop">Infinite loop</h5> 
  <p>An infinite loop is a loop whose execution never stops because there is no condition for exiting the loop (the second condition in the brackets). To write an infinite loop, just skip the condition for exiting the loop to make a construction like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (i=0; ; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}</code></pre> 
  <p>... or this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (i=0; ;) {
    console.log(i);
}</code></pre> 
  <p>... or even this!</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">for (; ;) {
    console.log('Hi!');
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Why is that? Since none of the conditions in brackets are mandatory, we can skip a few or even all of them. But since we skip the condition for exiting the loop, the loop becomes infinite.</p> 
  <p>Be careful with infinite loops: since there's no exit from an infinite loop, sooner or later the memory will overflow. This will make your computer freeze, and you will have to reboot it in emergency mode. Still, sometimes we need the loop to run endlessly, for example, when programming games or microcontrollers, so in these cases, the use of infinite loops is reasonable.</p> 
  <h5 id="forin-loop">For...in loop</h5> 
  <p>Let's examine another loop type related to the <code class="language-javascript">for</code> loop category, the <code class="language-javascript">for...in</code> loop:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">let animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'turtle'];

for (x in animals) {
  console.log(animals[x]);
}</code></pre> 
  <p>We get the following as the output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">cat
dog
turtle</code></pre> 
  <p>In this example, we created an array containing the names of animals. Next, we go through the indexes of each animal in the array and display the names of the animals, one per line.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Note that the 
   <code class="language-javascript">for...in</code> loop passes only through the enumerable properties of the object, that is, by properties that can be counted. 
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5> 
  <p>In this topic, we figured out what loops are and where we need them. We also looked at the syntax of two types of loops and learned what an infinite loop looks like in the case of the <code class="language-javascript">for</code> loop. </p>
